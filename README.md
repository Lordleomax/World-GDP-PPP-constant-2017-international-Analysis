# World-GDP-PPP-constant-2017-international-Analysis
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) are both economic indicators used to measure the economic performance and wealth of a country. However, they approach this measurement in different ways and serve slightly different purposes.

## 1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):**
   
   GDP is a key indicator of a country's economic performance and represents the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders within a specific time period, typically a year or a quarter. It is used to assess the size and growth of an economy.

   GDP can be calculated using three approaches:

   - **Production Approach (GDPp):** This approach calculates GDP by adding up the value-added at each stage of production in an economy. It measures the value of goods and services produced.

   - **Income Approach (GDPi):** This approach calculates GDP by summing all the incomes earned by households and businesses in an economy. This includes wages, profits, rents, and taxes minus subsidies.

   - **Expenditure Approach (GDPe):** This approach calculates GDP by summing all the expenditures made in an economy. This includes consumer spending, business investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports).

   GDP can be expressed in either nominal or real terms. Nominal GDP is not adjusted for inflation, while real GDP is adjusted to account for changes in price levels over time. Real GDP is often used to compare economic growth over multiple years.

## 2. **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):**

   PPP is a concept used to compare the relative value of currencies and to make more accurate comparisons of economic output and standards of living between countries. It adjusts for differences in price levels between countries, allowing for a more meaningful comparison of the relative purchasing power of two currencies.

   The "constant 2017 international $" mentioned in your question refers to a specific base year (2017) and a common currency (international dollars) used to make these comparisons. Here's how PPP works:

   - Suppose you want to compare the GDP of two countries, Country A and Country B, using PPP.
   - First, you choose a basket of goods and services that are commonly consumed in both countries. This basket includes items like food, housing, transportation, and more.
   - Then, you compare the prices of this basket in both countries. If the basket costs more in Country A than in Country B, you would say that Country A's currency is less powerful (weaker) than Country B's currency.
   - PPP is calculated by finding an exchange rate that equalizes the purchasing power of the two currencies when buying the basket of goods. This exchange rate is called the PPP exchange rate.

   The advantage of using PPP is that it provides a better understanding of the real standard of living in different countries because it takes into account differences in the cost of living. It allows for more accurate cross-country comparisons of GDP and income levels.

In summary, GDP is a measure of the total economic output of a country, while PPP is a method used to compare the relative purchasing power and standards of living between countries by adjusting for differences in price levels.
